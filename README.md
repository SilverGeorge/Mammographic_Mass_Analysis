# Mammographic_Mass_Analysis
This project aims to analyze mammographic mass data to aid in the prediction of benign and malignant tumors. Using features such as mass shape, margin, density, and patient age, we build machine learning models to classify masses, contributing to early detection and treatment planning efforts.
